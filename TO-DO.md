# To-Do List (Prioritized)

1. **Make the deep research mode working** - Fix the deep research mode, which is likely not working because the same API key is being called everywhere; investigate and resolve the API key usage issue. (Highest priority as it affects core functionality and was recently requested).

2. **Fix image generation** - Make it working (affects core functionality).

3. **Fix thinking display in responses** - Ensure the actual response after thinking is displayed properly, not just the thinking; avoid same font styling for both, and ensure the show/hide thinking button is visible.

4. **Fix stop generation button position** - Ensure the button stays on the right side, not on the left, as it looks weird.

5. **Add don't show modes in rewrite, just models, and readjust the order of models according to you on /chat** - Update the rewrite interface to hide modes and display only models, then reorder the models based on your preferences on the /chat page (e.g., prioritize advanced models like GPT-4, Claude, then others like Llama, Mistral for better user experience).

6. **Save user chats on cloud if logged in** - Implement cloud saving for logged-in users, while keeping existing local saving for non-logged-in users.

7. **Add branch switching for rewrites** - Enable rewrites to show as different branches with ability to switch back and forth (lower priority, enhancement feature).
